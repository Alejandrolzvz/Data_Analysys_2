# The Kings Age of Death time series seems to be not seasonal 
# and be analyzed with an additive model
# To estimate the trend component of a non-seasonal time series that can be 
# described using an additive model, it is common to use a smoothing method, 
# such as calculating the simple moving average of the time series.

# If you have a time series that can be described using an additive model with 
# constant level and no seasonality, you can use simple exponential smoothing to make 
# short-term forecasts.
# The simple exponential smoothing method provides a way of estimating the level at 
# the current time point. Smoothing is controlled by the parameter alpha; for the 
# estimate of the level at the current time point. 
# The value of alpha; lies between 0 and 1. Values of alpha that are close to 0 mean 
# that little weight is placed on the most recent observations when making forecasts 
# of future values.
